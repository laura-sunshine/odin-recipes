<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil </li>
    <li>1 onion, finely chopped </li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped </li>
    <li>thumb-sized piece of ginger, peeled and finely chopped </li>
    <li>1 small pack coriander, stalks finely chopped, leaves roughly shredded </li>
    <li>1 tsp ground cumin </li>
    <li>1 tsp ground paprika </li>
    <li>2 tsp garam masala </li>
    <li>400g can chopped tomatoes </li>
    <li>400g can kidney beans, in water </li>
    <li>cooked basmati rice, to serve</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a low-medium heat. 
        Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until softened 
        and just starting to colour. Add the garlic, ginger and coriander stalks and cook for a further 
        2 mins, until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the spices to the pan and cook for another 1 min, by which point everything should 
        smell aromatic. Tip in the chopped tomatoes and kidney beans in their water, 
        then bring to the boil.</li>
    <li>Turn down the heat and simmer for 15 mins until the curry is nice and thick. 
        Season to taste, then serve with the basmati rice and the coriander leaves.</li>

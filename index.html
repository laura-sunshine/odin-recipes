    <h1> Green As You Go Vegan Recipies</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my vegan recipie site! Green As You Go is all about helping you 
        to integrate plant based foods into your diet.</p>
    <p>Everyday millions of animals are slaughtered and held in inhumane
        and filthy conditions. There is no distinction between us and them,
        only that society has deemed them as lesser and not deserving of life.</p>
    <p>Below I have included a selection of some of my favourite vegan recipies,
        which I hope you can enjoy too!</p>

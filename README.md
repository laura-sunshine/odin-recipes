# Recipie page
This is my first project built as part of The Odin Project. I have created a vegan recipe page showcasing some of my favourite vegan recipes.
<p> On this project I learnt how to create a basic website using HTML. Some of the skills used include adding photos, adding links, using syntax such as strong to highlight sections of text as well as using headings. </p>
<p> After working through CSS Fundamentals, i've introduced some styling onto the front page of my website. I've changed colours, created buttons, and styled them using classes as well as learning to use span to highlight sections of text.
I haven't learnt flexbox yet, so i've been unable to align my buttons where I want them, but I will come back to this later.
